              The late 1800s and early 1900s saw the birth of the <br />{" "}
              automotive industry, with inventors and innovators <br />{" "}
              experimenting with different designs and propulsion systems.{" "}
              <br /> One of the earliest and most iconic pioneers was Karl Benz,{" "}
              <br /> who is credited with creating the first true automobile. In{" "}
              <br /> 1886, Benz introduced the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, a <br />{" "}
              three-wheeled vehicle powered by an internal combustion <br />{" "}
              engine fueled by gasoline. Reflecting on his groundbreaking <br />{" "}
              invention, Benz stated, "I do not dream at night, I dream all{" "}
              <br /> day; I dream for a living."
